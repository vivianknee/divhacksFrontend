        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Santa Fe Institute operates as an independent, nonprofit 501(c)(3), the Santa Fe Institute is the world's leading research center for complex systems science. Our researchers endeavor to understand and unify the underlying, shared patterns in complex physical, biological, social, cultural, technological, and even possible astrobiological worlds. Our global research network of scholars spans borders, departments, and disciplines, unifying curious minds steeped in rigorous logical, mathematical, and computational reasoning. As we reveal the unseen mechanisms and processes that shape these evolving worlds, we seek to use this understanding to promote the well-being of humankind and of life on earth.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Algorithmic Justice</h3>
        <p>Our first project focuses on the national issue of access to housing. Lenders, landlords, and brokers often use algorithms to decide whether to approve or deny loan and rental applications, but the historical and geographic data used to train those algorithms can give rise to bias against certain socioeconomic or racial groups. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the government agency charged with improving access to homeownership, recently proposed amendments that would effectively allow lenders to circumvent anti-discrimination lawsuits and avoid liability by blaming the algorithm, rather than its application.</p>
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence: Foundations to Frontiers</h3>
        <p>Our project aims to address foundational weaknesses in how intelligence itself is understood, which we believe is inhibiting progress at the frontiers of AI. Building on the Santa Fe Institute’s interdisciplinary culture and contributions to natural, artificial, and collective intelligence, our project will inspire new breakthroughs in AI research through concentrated, collaborative effort. To that end, we will bring together AI specialists and other researchers who think deeply about the nature of intelligence — irrespective of discipline.</p>
        <h3>A Theory of Embodied Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Our project aims to build a theoretical framework for embodied artificial intelligence that treats the brain, body, and environment as inseparable cognitive elements. This theory will guide the creation of artificial agents that adjust their neural networks (brains) to feedback from their bodies and surroundings. In our experiments, we do not program robots with specific behaviors such as taking steps. Rather, we tell them to seek out a rich variety of experiences by instructing them to maximize their “predictive information,” a notion developed within complexity science. From this principle, the agents’ behaviors emerge in a self-organized way. Like human children, our embodied agents discover their own behavioral possibilities through an interactive and exploratory process.</p>
        <h3>Cities, Scaling, and Sustainability</h3>
        <p>This project brings together urban planners, economists, sociologists, social psychologists, anthropologists, and complex systems theorists with the aim of generating an integrated and quantitative understanding of cities. Outstanding areas of research include: identifying general scaling patterns in urban infrastructure and dynamics around the world; quantifying resource distribution networks in cities and their interplay with the city's socioeconomic fabric; exploring issues of temporal acceleration and spatial density, and creating a rigorous framework for understanding the long-term dynamics of urban systems.</p>
        <h3>Dynamics of Wealth Inequality</h3>
        <p>We are creating dynamic models for understanding why some human societies are more unequal than others. From relatively egalitarian foragers to modern agricultural societies, we are investigating the broad spectrum of societal structures that underpin wealth dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Lifespan Extension Writing Group</h2>
            <time>October 6, 2024 – October 10, 2024</time>
            <address>Collins Conference Room</address>
            <p>“The Challenge of ‘Workspan’ with Longer Lifetime”: A major theme in geroscience is maintaining healthspan in the quest to extend lifespan. Living longer and well both may be promoted by working more years and, at larger societal and economic scales, require that people work longer. What are personal implications (volition vs necessity; ability vs frailty)? What are the local community implications (family structure; implications for wealth; creation of job opportunities for next generation)? What are societal implications (economics; social security; health care systems; place of youthful (or frail), but old people in society)? What should we do about potentially dramatic increases in lifespan that, in turn, would affect workspan? </p>

            <h2>The Theory of Genetics: Articulating and Formalizing Theories of Biological Information</h2>
            <time>October 7, 2024 – October 9, 2024</time>
            <address>Noyce Conference Room</address>
            <p>We will create a general framework that articulates all of these pathways, and unite them through the use of information theory, especially semiotics. The workshop will include theoretical biologists, empirical biologists, and philosophers. We will challenge workshop participants to create constitutive theories for subdomains of genetics, and the intersections of genetics with other domains of biology.</p>

            <h2>Entangled Adaptive Landscapes Facilitate Exaptation</h2>
            <time>October 15, 2024</time>
            <address>Noyce Conference Room</address>
            <p>The talk focuses on exaptation, where existing traits are repurposed for new functions, as a key element of Darwinian evolution. It examines gene regulation, which relies on transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that control gene expression. The study used a massively parallel experiment in Escherichia coli to explore how new TFBSs evolve exaptively. Researchers mapped adaptive landscapes for three transcription factors and found that evolution could proceed smoothly, with small, adaptive mutations creating new TFBSs. The study also revealed transcriptional crosstalk, where both old and new factors regulate genes, promoting the diversification of bacterial gene regulation.</p>
