        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Media Lab is an interdisciplinary creative playground rooted squarely in academic excellence, comprising dozens of research groups, initiatives, and centers working collaboratively on hundreds of projects. We focus not only on creating and commercializing transformational future technologies, but also on their potential to impact society for good.</p>

        <h2>Research Projects</h2>
        <h3>Co-designing Generative AI for Healthy Aging</h3>
        <p>The increase in life expectancy worldwide is a global success story, but along with reduced birth rates, it has resulted in a growing population of older adults and relatively fewer young adults available to provide care. Over 10% of the world’s population is over 65; by 2050, that number is expected to reach 16%. Many countries will experience a more extreme level of population aging. By 2050, the 65-plus cohort is projected to account for 35–40 percent of the populations of several industrialized countries. Countries experiencing a transition to such population structures face significant economic and social effects including potential shortages in key workforce roles driven by the retirement of older workers and increased demand for certain service categories such as professional and informal care providers and age-relevant medical services.</p>
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence: Foundations to Frontiers</h3>
        <p>This research aims to revolutionize auditory experiences by integrating AI-driven systems for enhanced sound control, envisioning a future where distracting noises are minimized and auditory focus is maximized through intelligent audio manipulation. It explores the potential of audio computers—devices that allow sophisticated sound control via natural language interaction—while also considering how visual cues can augment these primarily audio-centric systems for more intuitive sound selection and enhanced auditory perception. By leveraging information theory, control theory, and machine learning, the project seeks to develop a system that not only manipulates sound using advanced technologies but also provides a comprehensive mathematical framework to better understand the interplay between auditory and visual cues, enhancing personal and public environments from bustling workplaces to musical performances.</p>
        <h3>SleepSoundly</h3>
        <p>SleepSoundly is smart pillow case interface that aims to improve sleep quality by stimulating the brain during deep sleep. We are studying if a method called slow wave entrainment can improve sleep quality. The method involves presenting sensory stimuli, like sound, about once per second during deep sleep. These stimuli prompt the brain to produce stronger slow waves, the brainwaves associated with deep and restorative sleep. Prior studies in sleep laboratories have shown that slow wave entertainment can improve biological measurements of sleep quality. Based on these results, we are developing interfaces and software for performing such entrainment. We are testing whether slow wave entrainment with these devices can improve sleep quality and mitigate the problems caused by poor sleep.</p>
        <h3>Synthetic Sensations</h3>
        <p>Electrical stimulation has long been used in medicine to induce phosphenes, or visual sensations, in patients with visual impairments. Recent technological advancements have made this stimulation more accessible to the public, inciting a new era of research on neurostimulation for sensory enhancement. Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) can non-invasively induce visual sensations called phosphenes (bright flashes) in the visual field with cutaneous retinal activation. We explore the use of tACS to elicit visual sensations and explore potential use cases. We designed a wearable tACS system and conducted a study to understand the visual sensations we could elicit and their efficacy when applied to augmenting a users spatial awareness. We found that our device reliably generated synthetic sensations and, when applied, significantly augmented users' ability to "see" objects approaching from behind compared to users with no feedback. We hope to inspire future research using tACS in systems for sensory enhancement.</p>
        <h3>Sleep++</h3>
        <p>Sleep++ aims to improve sleep quality by stimulating the brain to enter deep sleep. Currently, insufficient and poor quality sleep represents a major health burden. Poor sleep is associated with a wide range of diseases,  as well as increased risk of accidents like car crashes. Current approaches to improve sleep in otherwise healthy adults include medication and lifestyle change--but these methods have significant drawbacks that limit their usefulness. We are testing whether a new method called slow wave entrainment can can improve sleep quality. In this method, sensory stimuli like sounds are played about once per second during deep sleep. These stimuli prompt the brain to produce stronger slow waves, the brainwaves associated with deep and restorative sleep.</p>

            <h2>MIT Decentralized AI Summit</h2>
            <time>October 11, 2024 9:00am — 3:00pm EST</time>
            <p>In today's AI landscape, data, computation, and governance are centralized. Decentralized AI offers a promising alternative leveraging intelligent, network-based approaches to improve collaboration, incentives, and innovation at the edges. It offers a promising alternative enabling collaboration between distrusted, disincentivized, and disinterested entities.</p>
